IT Project Management
    Introduction
        - Objectives
            - To learn how Software is created
                - with an emphasis on modern software development life cycle
            - To examine the Programming Community in the Philippines
        - For this class, we will be focusing on two things:
            - PM in Software Development
            - IT Communities
        - We will be doing a bottom-up approach.
            - Which means we will be doing practical work
            - Then, we will discuss what we've learned and show how it affected the high-level overview
